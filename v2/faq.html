<span class="faq">WHAT IS SPARK CARE?</span><br>
Spark Care is a way for Walmart Health & Wellness associates to recognize other associates’ Moments of Care – Safety, Kindness, Connection and Simplicity.
<br><br>
<span class="faq">WHAT ARE THE FOUR MOMENTS OF CARE?</span><br>
<b>Safety</b> must never be sacrificed. Everything must be safe. This encompasses personal safety, compliance and the preservation of personal health information.
 <br><br>
<b>Kindness</b> reflects a desire to show compassion and empathy. Everyone should demonstrate kindness – even when they are busy.
<br><br>
<b>Connection</b> captures our desire to build a relationship with our customers and patients. Relationships can be made by the smallest gestures, like knowing a customer’s name.
<br><br>
<b>Simplicity</b> is a business need. Health care is complicated in the eyes of our customer. Our processes and communication should be simple to understand.
